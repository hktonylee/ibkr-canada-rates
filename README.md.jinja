## Historical rate snapshots

The charts below track the latest 31-day history for several popular margin
and interest rate tiers across USD, CAD, and JPY.

{{ README_INJECT_CHARTS }}

This repository contains the daily IBKR Canada interest and margin rates, with the latest snapshots available in {{ README_INJECT_LATEST_SNAPSHOTS }}.

The data is updated daily at 6AM EST.

## Usage

Run the Python updater to download the latest HTML pages, parse them, and
write CSV snapshots into `data/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>`. The project uses a `src`
layout, so set `PYTHONPATH` accordingly before invoking the module:

```
PYTHONPATH=src python -m ibkr_rates.update --output-dir data
```

For development or testing you can point the updater at local HTML copies
instead of fetching from the network:

```
PYTHONPATH=src python -m ibkr_rates.update \
    --output-dir data \
    --interest-html tests/interest-rates.html \
    --margin-html tests/margin-rates.html
```

## Automation

The scheduled GitHub Actions workflow runs the updater daily and pushes the
resulting CSV snapshots directly to the default branch. When the workflow runs
for a pull request it creates a temporary branch named `auto-update/<run-id>`
and pushes the generated data there so reviewers can inspect the diff without
affecting the base branch.

## Testing

```
pytest
```
